<h1>komionm</h1>
This is a Python script to download said `Komi Can't Communicate` chapters. This code is messy, idk why i use `asyncio` and `aiohttp`. This script scrape [w3.komisanwamanga.com](https://w3.komisanwamanga.com) for the chapters

## Python Dependencies
1. asyncio
2. beautifulsoup4
3. aiohttp

## Just some stuff
1. This script works for `Termux` legacy version (`<= 0.83`) or later.
2. `GNU/Linux` version of install is untested, but i think it works just by looking at the command.
3. This script is tested on Python 3.8, but i think Python 3.6 or above should work

2. StackOverflow that helps me making this script.
