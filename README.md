# komionm
This is a Python script to download said `Komi Can't Communicate` chapters. This code is messy, idk why i use `asyncio` and `aiohttp`.

## Windows version ?
Look, i do not have any PC and i made the script on my phone. I dont know how Python works on Windows and how to make a batch script. Im sorry, but i can't say anything for Windows

## Requirements
1. [Python](https://www.python.org)
2. sed
3. xdg-open

## How To Install
```
git clone https://github.com/bestpeople105/komionm.git && cd komionm
sh install.sh
```

## Python Dependencies
1. asyncio
2. beautifulsoup4
3. aiohttp

## Just some stuff
1. This script works for `Termux` legacy version (`<= 0.83`).
2. `GNU/Limux` version of install is untested, but i think it works just by looking at the command.
3. This script is tested on Python 3.8, but i think Python 3.6 or above should work
